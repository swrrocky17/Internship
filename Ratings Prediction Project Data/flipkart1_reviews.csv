pros: good metallic finish and fast processor
but cons are : 1)this laptop has heating issue while charging, it heats up quickly and adapter too.
2) the track pad is not very responsive sometimes even after 2 or 3 clicks.

apart from these cons the feathers are very goood.

1688,Moderate,The quality of the laptop body is questionable. If you lift this laptop from the right end the lower part of the body made from cheap plastic makes sound. The laptop hinges are very bad. After few months it can break. Also the speaker makes some constant noise when played any video from YouTube. Also the laptop is china made. So if you went for dell thinking its a non Chinese brand thats not the case. Better go for HP or Lenovo.,2

1732,Very Good,Everything is good except display. The processor is very fast and battery backup is good. Charging is also fast. Booting time is very small but screen is pathetic. You can't see screen properly at a small angle from screen. Redmi phones are famous for good Quality screens but what did redmi do in laptop screen is hard to understand. I would not recommend this due to screen quality. Go for a good quality LED screen laptop.,4

Display :- brightness level is good, screen is not IPS panel and so it's not very shiny and side angles visibility is low. But you are buying a laptop and not TV.


Also on keyboard, FN key is always On so pressing F1 to F12 Activates function keys instead of F1 to F12 value.
To sort this out use FN key + ESC key.",5

Even though i would say, games like valorant get about 80 fps.

Using battery saving mode, one can easily get 4hrs of battery backup.

3579,Very Good with few caveats,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart",4

3655,Mind-blowing purchase,"Review after 1 week of usage
Best gaming laptop under 55k without a doubt
It comes with a simple design so it doesn't look like a normal gaming laptop.Battery is good.

Only con I noticed is with the colour of the display some colours are not so perfect but it is not a con which makes us difficult to use the lap and it can't be noticed easily

Highly recommended laptop below 55k👍",5
3656,Wonderful,Day 1 of purchase - The laptop looks way Awsome in real then on photoes ... The laptop is fast and boots up just in 6-10 seconds thanks to the SSD that is ! At this price the laptop is quite decent.. Only thing I hated was that in just an hour of gaming it heated up like a freaking heater...,4
3657,Mind-blowing purchase,"Best deal in this budget 👌, boot in just fraction of seconds, really very very fast, performance wise it's best in segment, N-Vidia Graphics card along with 512ssd, makes ideal for gaming & other hevy tasks, only drawback is battery but we should understand that gaming laptop consume more power, rest of the things you will enjoy for sure. What I wants in a laptop it has all.",5
3658,Very Good,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.,4

Battery - ok
Display -good
Build quality : could ve been better
Heating fastly while playing GTA 5 in high setting

Battery in normal - 3-4 hr
Gaming (gta 5 in very hight set) - 1-2 hr


My opinion about this lap : if you want good gaming with other works go for this. Don't expect battery from this laptop and build quilty is also not that great. Buy this lap when it's price is under 53k ...

3665,Super!,It's a beast laptop but only 1 thing I don't like is in keyboard center it gets hot n left n right side will be cool. While continues playing slowly the hotness spreads to left or right. But except hot . It's best for 12 hours gaming + steaming live.,5
3666,Brilliant,"Amazing performance.
Using battery saving mode, one can easily get 4hrs of battery backup.

However, the hinge is a BIG BIG Issue for the laptop. If you regularly use it, the hinge is guaranteed to break down in 1 years time as soon as the Warranty period is over. A normal screw hinge, rather than a spring system is recommended. The Modern 15 is a better option in that case.",3

Everything is perfect abt the laptop only con i found is the overtime durability of the hinge or it can only be the the tightness of it for easy one hand opening (i don’t think there will be problems with it)because it feels kind of flimsy, rest of the build quality is good.

Definitely use a cooling pad if u r a regular heavy user or gamer.",5

AMD has done a great job with their Ryzen 5500u processor; and that coupled with NVIDIA 1650 GPU delivers an exceptional performance.

CONS:
Display could be much better. Build quality is below average.",4
4350,Super!,"Only one word - Superb!

It boots up lightening fast and ready to use in just 5-8 seconds. Freaking awesome speed! All the games and apps that i have tried ran smoothly as expected and sometimes beyond expectations. The two downsides are its poor webcam ( which we never use) and the battery. The battery runs out very fast while gaming. 1-2 hours. Otherwise for normal use it will stay up for at least 5-7 hours. You can watch detailed performance reviews on YouTube and all of them are mostly true.",5

I had made a replacement and the new piece also has the same issue. I'm sure many others would have noticed. It's very negligible like an earth shock but still a defect nonetheless. When you have kids around it would be a concern to keep using it. Otherwise it's a great value for money product. Love the rest of it.",3

Useless data. Better buy mi for it's robust and reliable ecosystem. Even my 4 years old mi band has a better data accuracy and integration than this. Don't get carried away by the looks and features. Yes it's good. But all these is pointless if I'm not able to use it for any calculation of calories.",1
6394,Just wow!,"Dizo Watch 2 sports very very good performance Battery backup, Display and everything is working very well 😊 . Very fast delivery Only 1 day delivery and last thing is Delivery boy also good person name is V Gangadhar well done brother for the fast delivery 😊😊",5
6395,Very Good,Touch experience is awesome. Sensors work properly. When you raise your hand & walk then it doesn't count steps properly otherwise everything is nice in it & some times it count automatically(Ghost tracking) when I don't walk just only move my hand.,4
6396,Terrific,"*Watch is very light and comfortable

*Sleep tracking and nap are also accurate",5
6397,Good,"Decent smart watch,
1.doesn't carry out real time heart rate monitoring very efficiently, it does work good when I wore it inline with my palm
2.the battery saver is of no use, just cuts off mobile pairing but the heart tracking is still on
3.the sleep monitor isn't getting updated in the app, I gave the feedback in the app but it's just bot talk",3
6398,Worth every penny,"1. Battery is great and lasts easily upto 10 days.
2. Design is sleek and stylish
3. Connectivity with phone is good and easy to track activities like sleep, step counter, calories burnt etc.
4. Sports modes are good too almost all types of workouts and training modes available.
5. Music control and silencing/rejecting calls is good

Overall a good value for money product.

This watch main purpose is for activity tracking, If that doesn't work well, who cares about looks and design.

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent. If you are searching for a smart watch with more sports mode and watch looks below 2K, then it will be the best watch for you. Absolutely loved it. My only suggestion for the developers is to add screen lock to this watch.",5

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent. If you are searching for a smart watch with more sports mode and watch looks below 2K, then it will be the best watch for you. Absolutely loved it. My only suggestion for the developers is to add screen lock to this watch.",5

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Useless data. Better buy mi for it's robust and reliable ecosystem. Even my 4 years old mi band has a better data accuracy and integration than this. Don't get carried away by the looks and features. Yes it's good. But all these is pointless if I'm not able to use it for any calculation of calories.",1

1.doesn't carry out real time heart rate monitoring very efficiently, it does work good when I wore it inline with my palm

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent. If you are searching for a smart watch with more sports mode and watch looks below 2K, then it will be the best watch for you. Absolutely loved it. My only suggestion for the developers is to add screen lock to this watch.",5

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Can't connect in just in single tap have to wait more than 1 min sometimes need to try 2-3 times.

Useless data. Better buy mi for it's robust and reliable ecosystem. Even my 4 years old mi band has a better data accuracy and integration than this. Don't get carried away by the looks and features. Yes it's good. But all these is pointless if I'm not able to use it for any calculation of calories.",1

1.doesn't carry out real time heart rate monitoring very efficiently, it does work good when I wore it inline with my palm
2.the battery saver is of no use, just cuts off mobile pairing but the heart tracking is still on
3.the sleep monitor isn't getting updated in the app, I gave the feedback in the app but it's just bot talk",3

6988,Great product,"Awesome

I bought this watch a week ago. Initial impression and look was fantastic. At first battery drained fast while connecting to mobile app. After that battery standby was excellent. If you are searching for a smart watch with more sports mode and watch looks below 2K, then it will be the best watch for you. Absolutely loved it. My only suggestion for the developers is to add screen lock to this watch.",5
6989,Terrific,Excellent worth to money I am satisfied this smart watch thx Flipkart ☺️☺️🙏,5
6990,Super!,"Loved the product!
But some things need to improve like :
1. Sports mode they said 110+ but on counting they are only 15-16
2. In future update it need to be improvised in menu like new menu interface should be added",5
6991,Decent product,"THE GOOD AND THE BAD

THE GOOD

It's my first smart watch so I can't compare it with others but as my first experience I can say watch didn't disappointed me. It's been 4-5 days I'm using this and the experience of wearing this is good performance in bit lag but work is worth. Features are good for 2.5k watch. The screen quality is good.

THE BAD

Can't connect in just in single tap have to wait more than 1 min sometimes need to try 2-3 times.
Charging cable wasn't in the box so I had to buy ...

6992,Must buy!,"A common complaint about fitness bands is their tiny screen size.
The Dizo Watch S features a big rectangular frame, the sides of which are made of metal.
The Dizo Watch Sports 2 feels good while using. The UI is smooth and we haven’t noticed any stutter on the watch.
The Dizo Watch S comes with a plethora of features, like other fitness bands, it features a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen level tracker, breath training, calories burnt, sleep count, etc.

Data is only visible within Dizo app and not accessible to Google fit or healthify me.
Useless data. Better buy mi for it's robust and reliable ecosystem. Even my 4 years old mi band has a better data accuracy and integration than this. Don't get carried away by the looks and features. Yes it's good. But all these is pointless if I'm not able to use it for any calculation of calories.",1
6994,Just wow!,"Dizo Watch 2 sports very very good performance Battery backup, Display and everything is working very well 😊 . Very fast delivery Only 1 day delivery and last thing is Delivery boy also good person name is V Gangadhar well done brother for the fast delivery 😊😊",5
6995,Very Good,Touch experience is awesome. Sensors work properly. When you raise your hand & walk then it doesn't count steps properly otherwise everything is nice in it & some times it count automatically(Ghost tracking) when I don't walk just only move my hand.,4
6996,Terrific,"*Watch is very light and comfortable
*Notification are fast and accurate.
*Visible in sunlight *Backup flashlight (manageable)
*Spo2 & heart monitor are mostly accurate i can say (95%) *Find my phone works great if your connection is under the range
*Sleep tracking and nap are also accurate",5
6997,Good,"Decent smart watch,
1.doesn't carry out real time heart rate monitoring very efficiently, it does work good when I wore it inline with my palm
2.the battery saver is of no use, just cuts off mobile pairing but the heart tracking is still on
3.the sleep monitor isn't getting updated in the app, I gave the feedback in the app but it's just bot talk",3
6998,Worth every penny,"1. Battery is great and lasts easily upto 10 days.
2. Design is sleek and stylish
3. Connectivity with phone is good and easy to track activities like sleep, step counter, calories burnt etc.
4. Sports modes are good too almost all types of workouts and training modes available.
5. Music control and silencing/rejecting calls is good

Overall a good value for money product.
Go for it if your budgets 2-2.5k",5

According to me there should me more featured in it as there are many watches in same price with more better features therefore I would not recommend it . You could get a better product in same budget. Only the battery and body of the watch is good but the function are no at all good . Some apps do not even open. There are only 6 apps working all related to health only.. I WOULD NOT SUGGEST,1
7901,Highly recommended,"I am now editing my review after 1 year of use so the best thing is I am getting a battery backup of 20+ days by using everyday and this is mind blowing because even the mi bands are giving similar battery backup but it depends on how you use it strap quality is really good till now and the Activity tracker is 80% accurate (pedometer, heart rate, spo2) vibration is strong enough if you use itit.

7906,Not good,Notifications are biggest issue. You have to do the setting again and again in the app. Even after that notification functionality doesn't work properly. No wonder why it's so cheap. Won't recommended to buy it. As there is no use of the smart watch if you don't get proper notifications.,2
7907,Best in the market!,"This is my first review, for any product!
It is fully based in the initial usage!
This is my first smart watch as well! Literally I was worried about the dialer size, since my wrist is very small and thought it would be larger! But it fits perfectly to my wrist!
As I said, in my initial usage, the watch holds really good, functionalities working fine!
Display is in a descent size! Strap is in a good quality! Vibrations work fine! Notifications do comes with a good prompt!

7909,Just wow!,"After 2 days of research, 100 of reviews and YouTube videos I finally got this with Republic Day offer for 2k. Mostly it is 2.5k. its worth the money. Compared to nearest competition (noise, Miband, realme) it is not only cheaper but has more features like water resistance (I have literally washed it with soap!). Oxygen sensor is accurate (checked with actual oxymeter), walking tracker is bang accurate. For price of an Apple watch you can buy Boat watch for your entire apartment.",5

7912,Wonderful,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.

7918,Nice,"Hi all...this is my first review in flipkart and basically I don't what to do the same..but now I am disclosing my views is that how really the watch works.

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.
1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

I am writing this review after 7 day of use.
Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed.
Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc.
In 2000 this is the best watch.
It looks very premium.
Battery can last upto 4-5 days.",5

7921,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
7922,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

Like the review if you get helped out.",5

7930,Not good,"First of all device should hav at least some battery inside the box.

Pros:
1 Most sensors at this price (at least on paper).
2 Nice build quality especially Strap and dial material.

Cons :
1 Heart rate sensor shows 15-20 beats more than actual (in my case).
2 SPO2 values differs upto 10-15 % every time when checked continuosly.
3 Step count is not as accurate as my MI band 5.
4 OS is not furnished right now.",2

It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3

8016,Nice,The 1st impression and looks arr so good. Facing connectivity issue with Noisefit app. Noise have to improve their App features. Another major issue is Battery. They are telling 10 days Battery back up. I expected atleast 7 days. But ita very poor. With in 24 hours more than 40% charge down. This is the 2nd I am using this. I think the battery last up to hardly 3 days. Except this the watch is very nice in this price range.,3

1.when call notification is show on watch, it only shows the number.not the name of the saved contact.If you memorise all number then no problem.
2.At the time of driving bike ,if the wrist awake mode is active.then the watch awake in every second.

Noise guys needs to polish their smartwatch app. Smartwatch faces specially not that classy. Yes some of them are. There must be an option for text customisation in custom face option. One should be able to reposition the texts as per selected background images.

It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Overall its a good device in this ...

8380,Terrible product,The watch is good but not up to its price . According to me there should me more featured in it as there are many watches in same price with more better features therefore I would not recommend it . You could get a better product in same budget. Only the battery and body of the watch is good but the function are no at all good . Some apps do not even open.

8386,Not good,Notifications are biggest issue. You have to do the setting again and again in the app. Even after that notification functionality doesn't work properly. No wonder why it's so cheap.

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.

2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.

8771,Just wow!,"Good watch during sports activities. Nice design.. Display of step counting is very small for older people. Bp, oxigen count and heart beat are almost accurate... Any way good item.. Battery will last for 6 days",5
8772,Does the job,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3

8871,Good,"Don't expect surprises, it's best for the price only. Screen size is too small, strap quality is average, UI is not so smooth, battery capacity need to check on the go. What I didn't like most will be the screen - both quality as well as size. I bought this cos ot has BP, spo2 and heart rate monitors.",3
8872,Wonderful,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.

If you are in the market for an entry level fitness tracker, this will do just good!!",4
8873,Highly recommended,"1. Light weight
2. Easy to use all the options
3. Wellness mode is awesome and lookalike accurate so far.

8878,Nice,"Hi all...this is my first review in flipkart and basically I don't what to do the same..but now I am disclosing my views is that how really the watch works.

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.
1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary ...

8879,Best in the market!,"I got it for 2K, in this budget this is the best watch.
I am writing this review after 7 day of use.
Earlier i faced some issues like restarting when try to sync data and data loss when restart but after firmware update it is fixed.
Have many features like spo2, heat rate bp etc.
In 2000 this is the best watch.
It looks very premium.
Battery can last upto 4-5 days.",5
8880,Just wow!,"Awesome I suggest every one to buy this bez try new good battery life, good performance, looks classy",5
8881,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
8882,Mind-blowing purchase,"A genuinely review of the boat Strom watch

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.
Thank You

Like the review if you get helped out.",5

Value for money.
Seems very accurate on all features like step counting & sports.
13% change remaining on 6th day after first charging.
I like this product.",5
8885,Wonderful,"After lot of research, finally decided to go with Boat Smart watch. Got the delivery in 2 days. FlipKart is as usual rocking with speed delivery. I haven't fully checked all the options of the watch but as a first look, watch is good. Light weight. Syncs well eith mobile phone via ProGear App. Able to change the skin via cloud. So far so good. Will check other features and update my review later.",4

Touch display good

Screen is good

Not good product.",1

8889,Nice product,"If call function is it there this watch is awesome , and even we can't attend call but we can see notification and reject the call , very simplest design and limited app facilities. Heart beat measurements are accurate or not I'm not sure about is steps and other calorie function are normal like other smart watch and battery capacity is depends on usage specified by the product 🙂",4
8890,Not good,"First of all device should hav at least some battery inside the box.

Pros:
1 Most sensors at this price (at least on paper).
2 Nice build quality especially Strap and dial material.

Cons :
1 Heart rate sensor shows 15-20 beats more than actual (in my case).
2 SPO2 values differs upto 10-15 % every time when checked continuosly.
3 Step count is not as accurate as my MI band 5.
4 OS is not furnished right now.",2
8891,Just wow!,"Good watch during sports activities. Nice design.. Display of step counting is very small for older people. Bp, oxigen count and heart beat are almost accurate... Any way good item.. Battery will last for 6 days",5
8892,Does the job,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3

Pros

It has created a healthy competition in the family. It does not allow your laziness to dominate your lifestyle.

9649,Nice,"Display is awesome. Features are there but what good it is if it doesn't work correctly. Like raise to wake is too sensitive that display gets on with moderate hand movement and also the watch says my bed is alive. My bed has heart rate, spo2 and one day I put my watch on bed and it also slept for 2 hrs.😱 They could fix it with some updates i guess. But for the money we should expect such flaws I believe.",3
9650,Nice product,"Value for money smartwatch.

Pros:-
1. The screen's visibility is good at indoors.
2. The watch is comfortable to wear
3. Good battery life(8-10 days) if always on-display is off
4. Sop2 and heart rate monitor shows accurate readings.

Cons:-
1. If always-on-display is ON then the battery will last for 2-3 days only.
2. The visibility is poor under bright sun.",4
9651,Nice product,"I am writing this review after 6 days use.
Battery backup is only 5 days if you use AOD ie; Always on Display battery will last for 2 days only. Display of this watch is quite Impressive and Dizo Does A brilliant work in design also. In this segment this is a value for money watch..now time for ratings..
I would like to give.
5 star for the Display.
3.5 Star For Battery.
5 Star for Design and Comfort.
4.5 Star For Activity Tracking.

9653,Wonderful,Quite good but Battery life with AOD is worst and also not visible in day tym...Need some improvement in battery life and AOD visibility...otherwise all form factors are good as well,4
9654,Value-for-money,"Good looking watch with limited features and compititive price.
The battery backup is on an average side because I am just getting 2-3 days of battery backup with always on display enabled and minimum notification (only text msg and emails limited to 4-5 per day).
All sensors works as expected and unlimited alarms can be setup (only vibrate).
Dial faces are limited and very old school and boring to be honest. They should add more cool faces which would hide the noticable notch at least.

Cons:
1.Battery life is pathetic. However i use it more as a watch and all trackings are off so i am ok with it.
2. Always on display is so dull that u cannot see anything in daylight/ sunlight. In a bright room also its too dull. It looks good in dark environment.

9656,Just wow!,"Great watch for the price. Looking is great too. Dial size is ideal for all wrist sizes. My wrist is relatively small but even on my wrist it fits well. Battery life is great, its been on 100% for last 7 hours with moderate usage. Plenty of watch faces available. App is decent, sometimes takes time to load all watch faces but not a dealbreaker. I'd say go for it if you want a great fitness tracker with looks of a premium watch.",5
9657,Simply awesome,This is a masterpiece from Dizo. The only drawback which I feel is there are only four inbuilt watch faces in the watch and you can only add and save one extra watch face from the app. The watch faces in the app are good but not up to the mark. If Dizo fixes these in its upcoming updates then it would be tremendous. Otherwise everything is great in this smart watch...,5

The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.

10385,Not good,"Dizo application is totally useless. It disconnect the watch every time you minimise the app. So pathetic. Battery lasts about 4 days. Not good enough.
But one thing, the watch looks premium and stylish 👍. That’s the only thing I like so much.",2
10386,Nice,After using this almost 2 months I just says it's a good smart band battery will work for 5 to 6 days and most importantly its just a piece of digital watch. So if you really want to buy a smart watch plz get somethg else. Good thing in this id the trackers works almost correct.,3
10387,Fair,"Liked the watch as worthy ☺️
But small small unsatisfieds
Like
* can't mute & attend phone calls,
* Tap to wake is not in this,
* Battery life is not that much
but okay.... Other qualities r good",3
10388,Fair,"Used for three days…
Pros..
Averge battery life
Conz….
Display is averge quality dont expect near to amoled
Build quality average
Raise to wake response is very bad … so much lag
Sensor quality is not that much aacurate
Overall…
Just a showcase smart watch dont buy it .. if you need an accurate and good display one.",3
10389,Not good,"Battery life 4 to 5 days only
Step record is not accurate it count when you work with you hand also even sitting on bed if you move hand it coun your steps lol even it count heart beat rate on bed table wherever you place nothing is accurate 😆
Nothing is good but only for show off you can buy this product... Look is ok",2

Go for fitness bands.. Else if u want for looks and party wear watch u can go for this.. Looks super cool.,4

I have found few hiccups in these areas. Especially the steps tracking, When I was traveling by bus, it was counting the steps, atleast it should've taken into effect the GPS, to check by how much speed the location was getting changed. Without walking, it showed that I've completed 10k steps..😂😂

And, when I switch off the device and switch it on after 2 days, it is still carry forwarding...

The best is the battery backup, it will not say that it will last for what it is said, but it still performs better than others in the market.

Other features like oximeter, heart monitor are very helpful in this covid time... They are not the exact but still very much approximate.

Rest will see what it has to offer for me in the future updates 🤞",4

15263,Perfect product!,"5th day review, The watch is good, built is stylish, gives a classy look, but often gets disconnected from phone.. I haven't charged my phone for 5 days now, so I believe battery can last upto 10 days with moderate usage.

If connected to the phone, we receive notifications.. but doesn't support emoji(as shown in the pic), and obviously at this price segment we don't get an option to reply.

Display is descent, the lcd provides crisp images.. but the black could be more darker I felt.",5

Other fitness related features are standard and pretty accurate. The wrist flip gesture to check time has a slight delay in displaying and fee times don't respond. Hopefully a software update may correct this bug. Otherwise smooth experience. Quite happy with the buy,5

There are some minor bugs which must be fixed in update like.
1. Once watch calling feature is enabled, and if I try to call from mobile, it's directly connecting from watch and the vice heard in los speaker. Ideally this should not be the case. If called from mobile, then it should use mobile dialler and if called from watch it should use watch sirajee. Please fix this.

1. Once watch calling feature is enabled, and if I try to call from mobile, it's directly connecting from watch and the vice heard in los speaker. Ideally this should not be the case. If called from mobile, then it should use mobile dialler and if called from watch it should use watch sirajee. Please fix this.

17153,Not good,"Writing this review after using it for a few days. Buy this watch only if you want to go after the looks. It’s good only to view the time. The step count function doesn’t work properly and the syncing with the app is very poor. Also, cannot reject calls from the watch. Not sure of other functions but if the basic step function doesn’t work properly, I don’t see why one should buy it.",2

17159,Great product,Beautiful watch. Gifted this to my husband and he loved the watch and colour as well. A must buy product for gadget lovers..!!,5
17160,Worth the money,"The watch feels really comfy and attractive in the hand. The Realtime Heart monitor and other features such as oxygen level monitor stress level indicator and so on meets the expectations. The cons I felt is that the watch faces weren't that attractive and the battery level is not as promised. It drains off quickly. Last only 3-4 days, when it was promised for 10days. Overall it's a good smartwatch at a decent price.",4
17161,Must buy!,"This is a perfect Smart Watch... Got it for my younger brother for Rakhi. He absolutely loved it! ❤️ As per the reviews, it's better and cheaper than Noise Fit Ultra. So just go for it! 😊❤️",5

17165,Good quality product,"The watch looks soo good, but the noisefit application often disconnects the bluetooth to the watch which makes it to loose the 5 star rating.

Pros: Watch faces are good,
Good battery life,
watch interface is so smooth and well designed,
Heart rate monitor, SPo2, stress monitoring sensors works well

Cons: Noisefit app is worst
Disconnects the watch too often, (It is the major drawback)
Strap is not too extraordinary but just ok.",4
17166,Worth every penny,Bought this for my fiance for his birthday. He absolutely loved it! Looks super classy and damn good for the price you pay for! Definitely better than Ultra Pro! Check out Tech Burner's review to be more assured! 😊❤️,5
17167,Really Nice,"It's a great product overall.... really very impressed 🤩🙌🏻...
The only downside is the battery backup on this device is really very low I used it for 3 days only and it has dropped from 96% to 24% ...the battery may last for 5to6 day max on total use..yes I had use all the features in this 3 days and considering that it is fine by me.

5. Plastic casing",3
17169,Good choice,"Considering the cost of the smart watch, this is an easy go kinda accessory with adequate specs. Being a Fit Pro, it does have all the specs n features for fitness assessment though some like oxygen seem to be predetermined for all individuals. Overall, it's an ok-ok kinda watch that will meet your simple day-day needs of fitness assessment.",4
17170,Wonderful,Design wise very good. After one month use it starts slow responding for calls and notifiactions. I think its need to be upgarde with faster reponse. Otherwise its very easy to use and looks very comfortable on my hand.,4

17176,Very Good,"Review after 7 days of usage:
Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

17193,Good choice,Nice budget smartwatch with basic features. It lags a bit sometime when 2 or more activities going around at the same time.

A very good product to wear when in move.,4

18733,Pretty good,"Very important: Dell should change the non-standard plug on the power cord from 16A to 5A.

Workaround: I am using my old monitor's power cable for my sockets. Otherwise, use old PSU cable or buy a 16A to 5A adapter. (A = amperes or amps)


Despite the fact that the monitor supports FreeSync, it's not suitable for gaming as there is ghosting.

If you come from higher resolution + High DPI monitors then you may not want to buy a 27 inch 1080p monitor. You can opt for the 24 inch model.
